Project 1 by Andy Fernandez, Luis Gonzalez, Godday Ogbo, and Bamidele Funminiyi Samuel 
•	Abstract
o	Our project is to examine job posting data in a few major cities. As someone looking to get into the data science field, and possibly move for the job, our job market data will examine relationships between number of jobs, salary, cost of living, type of business, top company ratings, skill requirements and related questions.
•	Possible questions to answer:
o	How many jobs per city
o	How have salaries changed per cities over time
o	How is the cost of living per city and how does that affect salary
o	What are the counts of small vs large businesses per city
o	What are the company ratings for the top (per count) jobs
o	Are there any difference in skill requirements for jobs in each city.
•	Sources for the data
o	Indeed
o	Census
o	Zillow for housing data
o	Google Places
